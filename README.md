# experimental singularity container recipes for dask

The recipes define Singularity containers, which can be built locally (or on SingularityHub), that contain a larger dask environment and dependencies. Some tools are included for convenience. Functionality not guaranteed for use with SingularityHub. Tested and working versions are in the _singularity_ project.
